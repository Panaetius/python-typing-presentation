# Python Typing

---

# Agenda

1. Why use typing (or not)
2. Python Type Checkers
3. Strict typing
4. Some typing techniques
5. Pitfalls and oddities
6. Moving to typed python code

---

# Why use typing

- More safety/less bugs
- (Better) type hints in your editor
- Makes it easier to communicate intent and understand code
- Allows making invalid states unrepresentable
- Makes refactoring safer

---
# Why not use typing

- There are edge cases that don't work well
- Takes some effort to add to existing large code-base
- Sometimes a pain fighting to get annotations for code that is obviously correct
- You don't have any strict requirements for safety/your code is trivial

---

# What is typing in Python

```Python
def encrypt_rsa(public_key, data):  
```
--

```Python
def encrypt_rsa(public_key: rsa.RSAPublicKey, data: bytes) -> bytes:
```

---

# Type checkers

- Mypy (Python)
- Pyright (JS, Microsoft)
- Pyre

--

But:

- Neither of them really checks everything üôÅ
- both have edge cases that the other doesn't have üôÅ
- Mypy is the reference implementation
  - But the reference leaves out many behaviors as undefined üôÅ
- Pyright is faster but not meaningfully so (10s vs 30s, but actually 1s)
- Pyright is used by VSCode (and works as a language server)
- Pyre seems not that mature, very little docs

---
# Strict typing in Renku

There is `mypy --strict`, but we don't use that.

- it does not allow using e.g. just `x: dict`. It requires every generic to be spelled out
- it complains about some valid async code annotations

---

# Strict typing in Renku

But just `mypy` isn't strict enough, so we use:
```toml
warn_unreachable = true # no unreachable code
warn_redundant_casts = true # no `cast(...)` that's not needed
warn_unused_ignores = true # no unused `# type: ignore`
warn_return_any = true # no ` -> Any ` return
strict_equality = true # equality checks need to be overlapping types
check_untyped_defs = true # check functions that aren't annotated
allow_redefinition = true # allow changing variable type through assignment
disallow_subclassing_any = true # dont allow creating a subclass of `Any`
disallow_untyped_decorators = true # all decorators must be typed
disallow_incomplete_defs = true # don't allow partial annotations
disallow_untyped_defs = true # every function needs to be annotated
```
This allows escape hatches but requires everything to be typed.
And for nicer error output:
```toml
pretty = true
show_column_numbers = true
show_error_codes = true
show_error_context = true
```

# Typing Techniques

---

# Overloading

```Python
def read(path: Path, unicode: bool=False)-> str | bytes:  
```

--

```python
from typing import overload, Literal

@overload
def read(path: Path, unicode: Literal[False]=False)-> bytes: ...

@overload
def read(path: Path, unicode: Literal[True])-> str: ...

def read(path: Path, unicode: bool=False)-> str | bytes:  

```

--
```python
@overload
def process(data: list[int])-> float: ...

@overload
def process(data: list[str])-> str: ...

def process(data: list[int] | list[str]) -> str | float:
```

---

# Make invalid state unrepresentable

```python
class User:
    id: str | None

def save_user(user: User):
    if user.id is not None:
        raise Error("user already saved")

def update_user(user: User):
    if user.id is None:
        raise Error("can't update unsaved user")
```

---

# Make invalid state unrepresentable

```python
class User:
    ...
    
class NewUser(User):
    ...

class SavedUser(User):
    id: str

def save_user(user: NewUser)->SavedUser:
    ...

def update_user(user: SavedUser):
    ...
```
---
# TypeVars (Generics)

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Literal, Never, TYPE_CHECKING

New = Literal["New"]
Saved = Literal["Saved"]
UserState = TypeVar("UserState", New, Saved)

class User(Generic[UserState]):
    @classmethod
    def new(cls: type[User[New]]) -> type[User[New]]:  ...
    
    def __init__(self, user_state: UserState) -> None:
        if TYPE_CHECKING:
            self.__state = user_state # not actually used

    @property
    def id(self: User[New]) -> Never: 
       raise Error()

    @property
    def id(self: User[Saved]) -> str: ...

def save_user(user: User[New]) -> User[Saved]:  ...

def update_user(user: User[Saved]) -> None:  ...
```

---

# TypeVars (Generics)

```python
U = TypeVar("U") # Could be anything, but needs to be consistent when used

V = TypeVar("V", str, bytes) # must be either str or bytes, exactly

W = TypeVar("W", bound = str | bytes) # can be any combination, subtypes etc

# there is also covariant, contravariant and infer_variance parameters

```

---
# Type aliases

```python

type Vector = list[int]

# or pre 3.12
from typing import TypeAlias

Vector: TypeAlias = list[int] 

def add(a: Vector, b: Vector) -> Vector: ...
```
`Vector` and `list[int]` are treated as the same thing when checking. 
Can make code more readable and help shorten long type definitions

```python
from typing import NewType

Vector = NewType("Vector", list[int])

v = Vector([1, 6, 2])

```
Vector is a new, separate type and the original type always needs to be wrapped in e.g. `Vector(...)` call.
The new type is a subclass of the original, so can still be used in e.g. `def sum(values: list[int]):`

---

# Protocols

```python
from typing import Protocol

class CanQuack(Protocol):
    def quack(self) -> None:
        ...

def my_fun(x: CanQuack) -> None:
    x.quack()
```
- Defines interfaces for structural typing
- Does not need to be inherited from
- Anything that has a `quack` method satisfies this
- can also have properties defined instead of/alongside methods
- use `@runtime_checkable` if you want to use this with `isinstance`
---

# Special Types and other things

- Use `typing.Never` or `typing.NoReturn` for things that can't exist
  - the typechecker will fail if code can actually reach them
- `typing.Self` is the type of the enclosing class (no circular reference issues)

# Pitfalls

---

# Typing Decorators

They are functions that take a function and return a function

```python
from functools import wraps
from typing import ParamSpec, Concatenate, TypeVar

P = ParamSpec("P") # in 3.12 you can use `**P` directly
T = TypeVar("T")

def my_decorator(f: Callable[Concatenate[P], T]) -> Callable[Concatenate[P], T]:
    @wraps(f)
    def wrapper(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> T:
        print("my_decorator called")
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```
---

# Typing Decorators

Pro: 
- Type signature of derocated funtions isn't lost
- Type checks across decorators work (otherwise mypy just doesn't check them...)

Cons:
- Can't type keyword arguments, other than with `P.kwargs`
- Can't use TypeAliases for the  `Callable[...]` part to shorten it
- Can't use protocols for wrapped function either in many cases
- Annotating a decorator for class methods is a pain 
  - especially a decorator that supports both class methods and regular functions
- Borderline unreadable type signatures
- even worse with decorators that take arguments

---

# Typing Decorators

```python
_P = ParamSpec("_P")
_T = TypeVar("_T")
_WithMessageQueue = TypeVar("_WithMessageQueue", bound=WithMessageQueue)


def dispatch_message(
    event_type: type[AvroModel] | type[events.AmbiguousEvent],
) -> Callable[
    [Callable[Concatenate[_WithMessageQueue, _P], Awaitable[_T]]],
    Callable[Concatenate[_WithMessageQueue, _P], Awaitable[_T]],
]:

    def decorator(
        f: Callable[Concatenate[_WithMessageQueue, _P], Awaitable[_T]],
    ) -> Callable[Concatenate[_WithMessageQueue, _P], Awaitable[_T]]:
        @wraps(f)
        async def message_wrapper(self: _WithMessageQueue, *args: _P.args, **kwargs: _P.kwargs) -> _T:

```
```python
def dispatch_message(event_type):
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        async def message_wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):

```

# Libraries often aren't typed

- maybe there's an extra library just with types, like `types-urllib3` for `urllib3`
  - Check typeshed: https://github.com/python/typeshed
- You could add annotations yourself (haha)
- Just ignore external libraries without types üôÅ

```toml
[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = [
  "asyncpg.*",
]
ignore_missing_imports = true
```
---

# Sometimes I just want a dict...

Using 
```python
x: dict
```
is fine, no need for
```python
x: dict[str, Union[str, dict[str, Union[ str, str|int|bool|float]]]]
```
It is python after all...
Just don't overdo it.

---

# Use `cast`

- For returns of untyped third party libraries
- if you know it's physically impossible for it to be any other type
  - sometimes mypy just isn't smart enough

```python
from typing import cast

x: int
x = cast(int, some_external_call_that_you_know_returns_int())
```
This will shut mypy up

---
# If all else fails, just ignore it

```python
x: int = something_annoying() # type: ignore
```
but try ty be more specific to limit the impact of this
```python
x: int = something_annoying() # type: ignore[arg-type]
```
Mypy errors will tell you what to put in the brackets
```bash
 error: Module
"..." does not explicitly export attribute
"..."  [attr-defined]
```
the `[attr-defined]` in this case.

# Moving to typed Python code

---
# Moving to typed Python code

- You can gradually add types. Just add ignores for things that aren't typed yet (in pyproject.toml)
- Add types whenever you change code and unignore files as you add types
- Run mypy consistently in e.g. Github Actions and with `pre-commit`
- Annotate critical code first
- Try one of the automated annotations tools
  - Run your app (or tests) with it to gather data
  - Review the gathered data and let the tool apply it to your code, fix any issues that pop up
  - Don't bother with `autotyping`
  - `pyannotate` only works for Python < 3.10, could give it a try. 
  - `MonkeyType` works pretty well, but struggles with async functions. It's what I used on Renku

# jaxtyping

Typing for your tensors!

```python
from jaxtyping import Array, Float 

# Accepts floating-point 2D arrays with matching axes
def matrix_multiply(x: Float[Array, "dim1 dim2"],
                    y: Float[Array, "dim2 dim3"]
                  ) -> Float[Array, "dim1 dim3"]:
    ...
```

supports `jax`, `NumPy`, `Tensorflow` and `PyTorch`
